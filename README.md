# What is this project?

I was trying to get a way to remove all ads from my network directly from my router, blocking all ad source IPs.
Unfortunately, after code all this stuff I discovered that the router has the maximum of 40 IPs blocked, so was just a waste of time.

Feel free to check all the code, and send doubts or suggestions for me on my LinkedIn or e-mail.

Thanks :)
